# laravel-resource-generator
Generates a model, repository, controller and services
# Installation
Add laravelresource/resourcemaker as a requirement to composer.json :

{
    "require": {
        "laravelresource/resourcemaker": "1.*"
    }
}
Update your packages with composer update or install with composer install.

You can also add the package using composer require laravelresource/resourcemaker and later specifying the version you want (for now, dev-master is your best bet).
